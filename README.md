## 📘 Attendance Management System  

### 🔹 Project Overview  
The **Attendance Management System** is a smart and efficient solution designed for teachers to manage classroom attendance digitally.  
It eliminates manual record-keeping and automates the process of notifying parents about student absences.  

Teachers can log in, open their personalized dashboard, select a class, and mark each student as **Present** or **Absent**.  
Once attendance is submitted, the system automatically sends **email notifications** to parents of absent students.
